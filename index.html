      <h2> Take a Look at these Super Cool and Fun Hobbies!</h2>
         <div class = flexcontainer>
         <main>
            <section>Changing Tires</section>
               <img src="Images/tires.jpg" alt = "2 girls posing with new tires">
               <p>The inagural hobby for the Girls Who Hobby was when 3 recently graduated young adults realized that they had zero hobbies once they were done with school. After 2/3s of the Hobby Girls popped a tire in the span of a singular day, the first ever Girls Who Hobby hobby was hobbied: changing a tire. </p>


            <section>Rock Tumbling</section>
               <img src="Images/Rock Tumbling image.jpeg" alt = "image of rocks">
               <p>Rock tumbling is by far the most time intensive hobby for the Hobby Girls. Buy if you love rocks like we love rocks, the end product is worth the wait. It all starts with some rough looking rocks, then you toss them in your rock tumbling barrel with the first grit and some water and off you go.  There are 4 different stages of grit that you need to do to tumble the rocks, and each stage takes roughly a week to complete. So you have some rocks and a month to kill, rock tumbling may be for you!</p>

             <section>Baking with Friends</section>
                <img src="Images/baking 1.jpeg" alt = "image of pies with their baker">
                <img src="Images/baking 2.jpeg" alt = "image of a plate of cookies">
               <p>Baking with friends may be the #1 most yummy hobby, and we would know. There's nothing Girls Who Hobby love more than a new recipe. Plus the extras are a chance to bribe our co-workers into being our new friends, not that we've done this before multiple times... Anyway, get out there and try to make a super extravegent dessert, we dare you ;)</p>

             <section>Mixology</section>
                <img src="Images/mixology image 1.jpg" alt = "image of bottles and ingredients for a cocktail">
                <img src="Images/mixology image 2.jpg" alt = "image of 3 ladies posing around a fancy cocktail">
                <p>If there's one thing the Girls Who Hobby know how to do, it's mix a cocktail. We even got free merch from Rum Haven, a brand of natural rum, for featuring them in our content #notASponsoredAd. The key to any good cocktail is a carful balance of a good classic and a dash of experimentation. Either way, you've got a drink at the end of it, and that's a win in our book. </p>


             <section>T-Swift Brackets</section>
               <img src="Images/T-swift Image.jpg" alt = "image of a swifty in her natural habitat">
               <p>What happens when one mega Swiftie, one medium Swiftie, and one non-Swifite decide to rank every Taylor Swift song and album? They almost destroy the Hobby Girls. But, in the end, the constant bickering made us stronger. And who knows, ranking your favorite things with your friends may also be fun you all (or it might destroy you, either way the Girls Who Hobby may not be held liable for any irreconcilable relationships</p>

             <section>Cooking for a Crowd</section>
               <img src="Images/cooking image 1.jpg" alt = "image of a chef posing with a bowl of ramen">
               <img src="Images/cooking image 2.jpg" alt = "image of said bowl of ramen">
               <p>There's nothing the Girls Who Hobby gals enjoy more than going all out on a new recipe and making is take 4x the suggested prep time. Cooking new foods not only provides sustinence for you body, but it also builds friendships. And what's better than food and friendship?</p>

             <section>Doing Crazy Stunts</section>
                <img src="Images/danger 1.jpeg" alt = "image of two people skydiving from above">
                <img src="Images/danger 2.jpeg" alt = "image of two people in repelling harnesses">
                <p>And last but not least, the Hobby Girls have been known to do a crazy stunt every once and a while. Whether it's skydiving for a Hobby Dad's birthday or repelling for a fundraising event, doing something scary can be a good hobby if you're up for an adreneline rush. But do that at your own risk, we're not responsible for any faulty parachutes.</p>
